# About

Over the past 6 years, I have had the privilege of leading technical recruitment efforts for several early-stage startups in the tech industry. In these roles, I have been responsible for building high-performing teams, defining recruitment strategies, and managing relationships with key stakeholders.

As a technical recruiter, my primary focus has been on identifying, attracting, and hiring top talent for engineering, product, and design roles. I have developed a deep understanding of the tech landscape and market trends, which has enabled me to build effective sourcing and outreach strategies that reach and engage diverse and qualified candidates.

In addition to recruiting, I have played a critical role in defining and executing recruitment strategies that align with the overall business goals and culture of the organization. I have worked closely with hiring managers, executives, and cross-functional teams to identify key hiring needs, develop job descriptions, and design interview processes that assess for both technical and cultural fit.

Throughout my career, I have also been responsible for managing relationships with various stakeholders, including candidates, hiring managers, executive leadership, and external partners such as recruiting agencies and job boards. I have established a reputation for building trust, communicating transparently, and delivering results that exceed expectations.

Overall, my experience in technical recruitment has equipped me with the skills, knowledge, and passion to drive talent acquisition efforts that accelerate growth and success for early-stage startups. I am excited to continue this work and make an impact in the tech industry.

## PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

### Abnormal Security, San Francisco, CA August 2022 - March 2023
<em>Cybersecurity startup providing protection against the widest range of attacks using ML to detect behavior patterns
deviations and indicative signals of compromised account credentials</em>

### Senior Technical Recruiter
Recruited to join Abnormal’s technical recruiting team where I was responsible for seeing the candidate
experience through from end to end. Built candidate pipelines with top-tier candidates in a high-growth startup
environment.

● Filled mission-critical requisitions that had been open for 9+ months in the first 90 days, these
positions, on the Platform and Infrastructure teams, were crucial to the iterative plans the Abnormal had
in releasing a new product offering.

● Led daily standups with my team, and met with internal stakeholders to share reports and metrics on
the state of candidate pipelines, messaging response rates, and offer acceptance rates.

### Serverless Inc., San Francisco, CA June 2021 - June 2022
<em>The Serverless Framework empowers developers to build and operate serverless architectures on AWS, Microsoft
Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and 5 other cloud platforms. The Serverless Framework is one of the most popular
open-source projects on GitHub and is the industry standard for serverless development.</em>

### Founding Recruiter/ Recruiting Manager
Joined Serverless as their first in-house recruiter after 3 years of helping to build the team as an agency
recruiter. I was charged with the conceptualization, implementation, and execution of Serverless’s recruitment
playbook. I crafted supporting docs, hosted them as an internal wiki, and made them easily accessible for all to
use.

● Recruited technical and non-technical executives that would lead to the creation of Sales, Marketing,
and Accounting departments to be added to the company. These first hires allowed Serverless to go
from 0 to 1, and further deeper business objectives

● Created an end-to-end recruitment playbook for a Series B startup. This playbook took a
comprehensive approach to delivering a world-class candidate experience. Additional aspects included
guides for hiring managers, templates for employee outreach, selling equity, and closing strategies
<br>

### Kofi Group, Houston, TX July 2018 - June 2021
<em>A boutique recruitment agency focused on VC-backed startups</em>

### Senior Executive Recruiter/ Recruiting Manager
Recruited as Kofi Group’s founding recruiter for the SF/Bay Area. Starting from no presence and no book of
business, I drove new business development and candidate sourcing. This initiative led to record-breaking
sales and the growth of my team by 5 direct reports.

● Led record-breaking sales and team growth as a founding team member, leading to a company
restructuring its efforts away from oil & gas clients in the Houston area, to early staged, VC-backed
startups in the SF/Bay area

● Crafted the “Recruit the recruiter” playbook, in collaboration with the founder, to establish a creative
interview process that allowed us to gain competency signals through non-traditional interview
techniques

### ExpanXion, Westlake Village, CA February 2017 - July 2018
<em>A boutique recruitment agency focused on early-stage startups</em>

### Team Lead/ Senior Technical Recruiter
Joined as a Full-desk Technical Recruiter focused on new business development, candidate sourcing, and
stakeholder management. I later went on to effectively lead a small team of recruiters and sourcers, as well as
participated in the interview process for potential new hires.

● Took home the “Rookie of the Year” award due to leading sales in the company. This later led to
opportunities in mentorship, and leading a team of my own.

● Helped countless early-stage startups find mission-critical hires! It continues to be rewarding to see
startup founders that I have partnered with have successful exits in the market.
